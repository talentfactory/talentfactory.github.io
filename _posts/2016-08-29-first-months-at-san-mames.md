We started the season with 9 millions transfer budget, not bad at all,  but with our transfer regulation not enough to bring quality players. So we will be starting with no fresh players. We were hoping the return of Muniain will boost the whole staff.

As we were forced to play competitive matches pretty early this season, we did not have as much time for training as I would like. So I was a bit nervous about the season takeoff. Fortunately were our opponents in the EURO Cup not too. We were able to smash Brondby IF and Belenenses without any problems and qualified ourselves for the Group Stage.

We only lost the 3 games against Barcelona with not much between us and the world class players from the catalan side. So this wasn't a start we dreamed of but for good we could win the following two league games and started with 3 points to EURO Cup Group Stage.


But after that we went through a little crisis and didn't manage to win anything in the following games. But then a late equalizer in minute 94 worked wonders. We smashed the current number one of the Valencia CF with 4-0 at home, what a game!

After that glorious win, we did really well and just lost an away game against Atletico and the games in league and cup against Barcelona. Due to this results we managed to get ourselves ready for the fight for the european places.

Our EURO Cup Campaign went pretty well, we finished 2nd after St. Etienne and will be facing Rubin Kazan in the Knockout Phase.


# Deadline Day
I've to admin that I've never experienced a deadline day like this in Football Manager. I felt like every club in Europe was bidding for all my players (except Laporte). I decided to turn down all the bids, because where would I find anything like a replacement?

The good thing is PSG bid for this young talent that I've overseen while looking at my youth squads:

Asier Villalibre is a pretty decent guy and could step up when Aritz Aduriz reaches his retirement.




# Winter Transfer Window

During the first months of the season I could get some scouts to Europe to look for basque players. It looked like our campaing in the EURO Cup did attract the interest of Nacho Monreal and Stephane Ruffier. Both would add a lot of quality to our defense, but both of them were to expensive for the moment.

After a few days in 2017 Manchester United came with a bid for De Marcos and PSG for Iniaki Williams. I managed to get over 40 millions for De Marcos so there was no point in rejecting the offer as it was just too good. Chelsea was willing to pay the 54 million contract clause of Williams, but in the last moment they realized they did not have enough money on the bank.

But the millions from the De Marcos transfer were enough to snap up Monreal from Arsenal and Ruffier from Saint-Etienne.
