# Decision
I'm really excited about this new project for FM17. I wanted to improve a club with some good youth facilities to the top of Europe. The candidates where Everton, Valencia, Inter Milan, Athletic Bilbao, Schalke 04 and Olympique Lyonnais.

Although I've never managed a club from France in Football Manager, I decided to go with **Lyon**. They've a great academy (they're paying around 4 millions per year for it) and have already developed some high profiled players like Lacazette, Benzema or Martial. With only having up to 25 Managers in total, I think they're a pretty decent choice. The finances aren't actually too good, so it won't be too easy at the beginning of the game. But with the move to a brand new stadium in early 2016 we should be able to improve our finances a lot.

The biggest challenges will be to challenge the rich-kids from PSG, but I am confident we'll be able to surpass them. I am not sure if we can do it in the first season, but on a long term it is surely possible.

# Introduction

Olympique Lyonnais is a french football club from Lyon, which is located more or less between Paris and Marseille and has a distance of a bit more than 100km to swiss borders.

**Last season**: They finished 2nd in the 2015/1016 season in League 1, just staying ahead of Monaco with a better goal difference. Due to this results they will have guranteed a start in the Champions Cup Group Stage in the starting season. In the Coupe the France they've lost to PSG in the round of sixteen to with 0:3.

# Stadium

Olympique Lyonnais's Stadium is called Parc Olympique Lyonnais or Stade des Lumières. They've moved to their brand new Stadium in January 2016.  With a sellout of 55,169, the local side smashed Troyes AC with 4:1 in their first game at the new ground.

There were actually many reasons for almost ten years between the first renderings and the actual opening. And so it was the very last Stadium to be opened for the EURO 2016 in France.  So why did the stadium come last among France’s Euro 2016 venues?

Most importantly is that the Stadium was built with private funds instead of public-private partnership and construction of the budget proved challenging (loans from numerous banks alone secured only €145m). So the club owner Jean-Michel Aulas needed to get various other sources to be able to fund the stadium

Second major objective was to address protests of local residents. The stadium lies in Décines-Charpieu, a small commune in Lyon’s eastern suburbs, and consumed 44 hectares, becoming the area’s largest development. For Olympique this location was only the second choice, but proved a great choice due to great road network and proximity of the international airport.

The stands offers 60,000 seats and 10% of them are dedicated to corporate clients. Of the 6,000 business seats some 1,400 are spread across 105 skyboxes, while remainder is located in the stands, with access to a total of 8 large business lounges.

Increased capacity and corporate seat percentage allowed Olympique Lyonnais to expect matchday revenue to grow 3-5 times compared to the old Stade de Gerland once the new stadium is fully optimized.

**Interesting Fact: The roof of the Stadium manages to collect rainwater for internal use.**

# President

Jean-Michel Aulas is a French businessman and owner/chairman of the club. He owns the club since 1987 and was also the last president of the prestigious G-14. According to wikipedia his net worth was €348 million.

On 15 June 1987, Aulas took control of Olympique Lyonnais and invested in the club with the objective of turning Lyon into an established Ligue 1 side. His ambitious plan was to improve the club's status fight back  the first division within a timeframe of no more than four years. After ridding the club of its debt, Aulas restructured the club's management and reorganized the finances and, in a span of two decades, transformed the club from a second division team into one of the richest football clubs in the world.

Under Aulas's leadership, Lyon won their first ever Ligue 1 championship in 2002 and promptly started a national record-breaking streak of seven successive titles.

The club have appeared in the UEFA Champions League eleven times under Aulas, but it wasn't until the 2009/10 season that they advanced to the semi-finals. He is considered by many as a great football club president.

After establishing Lyon as a contender in French football the strategy was to buy good footballers from the other french club and sell them for exorbitant fees to clubs abroad. It was the time when players like Michael Essien, Mahamadou Diarra, Karim Benzema, Florent Malouda, Éric Abidal and Tiago Mendes have left the clubs for fees between 15 and 35 millions.

The club currently operates on the European Stock Exchange under the name OL Groupe, initialed OLG.English commentators have said he is a masterful owner and the only man to take the club to the next level. Possibly one of the greatest owners ever. Referred to in slang as the GOAT.

In April 2008, business magazine Forbes ranked Lyon as the thirteenth most valuable football team in the world. The magazine valued the club at $408 million (€368 m), excluding debt.

# Rivalries

Historically, Lyon has a healthy rivalry with fellow Ligue 1 club Saint-Étienne, whom they contest the Derby Rhône-Alpes with.[18] Since the club's dominance at the start of the new millennium, however, they have established rivalries with Marseille, Bordeaux, Paris Saint-Germain and Lille. Lyon also share minor rivalries with fellow Rhône-Alpes clubs Grenoble and AS Lyon Duchère.

# Shirts
Since the club's foundation, the primary colours have been red, blue, and white, with the latter being the most predominant of the three. During the early years of the club's existence, Olympique Lyonnais primarily played in all-white uniforms. In 1976, the club endured a drastic change to their kits, ditching the all-white uniforms for an all-red style, akin to English club Liverpool.
