Quite a in game time has passed on my FM save with Athletic Bilbao, definitely time or another update. The last time I wrote something we're heading to the second part of our first season in the Primera Division. The things weren't going to badly but anyway there was room for improvement.

We were on course to get into the european places and even with a open chance to reach the qualification for the champions cup. I want dive in directly to last season game, we played against Sevilla:

# Heartbreaking Season Finish

Before the game we're lying on the 5th place, which means had already made sure we'll be playing in an european competition next year. But there was even hope for more: Our opponent, Sevilla, was currently on the 3rd place, which went if we managed to get a positive result on this last match day we will be going at least for champions cup qualification round.

It was a tough game but in the end we did it, we managed to get a huge win in the 38th league game. The best thing about the result was even to come: Valencia CF, that was lying on 4th place before the last round did lose their last game and based on this result, we managed to get an amazing 3rd place in our first league season.

The league has been won by Real Madrid quite easy with Barcelona having some troubles even finishing 2nd. The performances in the EURO Cup were quite satisfying as well, with us advancing to the quarterfinals while losing to Juventus

# Summer Transfers
I did receive about 8 millions from the board for the following, in my opinion they could give get me some more money, as we will be awarded with a lot of money as we will be starting on the Champions cup group phase for sure.

With the likes of San Jose and Laporte tending to leave the club I decided to sign Jose Ramalho, a fast and agile center back. Ramalho isn't that good in the air, heading and his height stats aren't that good. Besides him, we wanted to bring Bayern player, Xabi Alonso to the club. With him having only 12 month left on his contract, we did hope to snap him him for low money.

The negotiation with the german club went pretty well, but the contract talks with Xabi were almost impossible with him asking for over 240k per week. So there was no chance getting him this summer. We might get another chance during the next transfer window.

Instead of signing Xabi Alonso, which was just not possible at this time, I decided to bring in some young wonderkinds. We snapped the crazy talented 16-year old center back Juan Manuel Gamez Heredia from Las Palmas:

Luckily we're able to get him, before Barcelona or Madrid did make an offer for him.


# New Season, New Tactic
I was quite happy with the tactic in the last season, exposing the thing in Football Managers Match Engine with the crosses from right backs. But I general I was not that happy with our weakness we did show in the defense.

So the new season we changed our system to a classic 4-4-2, with two Trequartista's in the front.


# Winter is here

The winter transfer window has arrived and this was another chance to get Xabi Alonso. In the meantime the board has granted us a lot more money and we were able so sign Xabi Alonso on 200k/w contract for 18 months.
As we did have an injury crisis in January 2017, I decided to sign him right away for a fee of 1.2.

# First Champions Cup campaign

As seeded as in the 2nd pot, a group with Bayern, Inter and APOEL was pretty tough. But we made it happen and managed to get over Inter Milan and qualify ourselves for the next round, what a achievement!

Only Real Madrid could stop us in the quarterfinals (actually we would have passed, if San Jose would have scored after a penalty kick). Nevertheless was it a very successful first champions cup, as I though after the draw that our journey would be finished after the group phase.

# Smashing the big guys
We managed to get even better results in the league and comparing with last seasons result, the football we have shown was amazing. Especially the wins agains Atletico, Barcelona and Madrid in January and March were crazy.

I've to admit, that for quite a long time I did not believe this was possible, but after the win against Barcelona in February, which gave us a 5 point lead, I started to begin this amazing achievement could get possible.
In the end we managed to win the league with a some points ahead of Barcelona and Madrid:

The key for our amazing league standing was clearly a run of total 16 wins, which was terminated with a loss against Sevilla.

# Summer Transfers
With our pretty successful champions cup campaign the likes of most of the best basque player could think about joining us. Even Antoine Griezmann could see himself at the San Mames, as he wanted to leave Atletico Madrid to play champions cup football. But him transfer fee of over 80 millions was too much and Liverpool managed to snap him up. I would have loved to see him at the San Mames.

A few weeks before beginning the new season we decided to sell Aymeric Laporte, as he was getting so unhappy at the San Mames. Read Madrid payed nearly up 50 millions, which I believe is a quite good deal for defender.

With that sale with had a transfer budget of around 80 millions. I decided to go for Jon Gaztanaga and Aritz Elustondo as a replacement and Ander Herrera as a new (high quality) addition for our midfield:

As I have already reached some huge success in my short career at Athletic Bilbao, I though for a moment to leave the club and take another challenge, but I would really like to see how my promising youngsters will be developing.

**But I can announce that Bixtente Lizarazu has taken over Costa Ricas national team on a part-time job.**
