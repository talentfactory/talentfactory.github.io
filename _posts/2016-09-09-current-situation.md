# Transfers
**OUT**: There's been some movement in the summer 2016 in Lyon.  Pretty early in the transfer window Samuel Umiti wanted to leave Lyon for his childhood dream FC Barcelona. The club did not want do force the player to stay longer in France and accepted a bid for 25 millions. Lindsay Rose, Bakary Kone, Heinri Bedimo, Steed Malbranque, Zakari Labidi and Arnold Mvuemba have already left the club for a very low fee or on a free transfer.

**IN**:To cope the loss of Samuel Umiti, who was developed at the club, the club decided to snap the 20 year old  Emanuel  Mammana from River Plate for a fee of 7,5 millions. Maciej Rybus and Nicolos N'Koulou joined the club as well.

**RUMOURS**: The biggest question for the supporters during this summer transfer window, was if Lacazette would keep on playing at Lyon or not. Arsene Wenger was told be interested to get him to strengthen up his squad after a bad start.
